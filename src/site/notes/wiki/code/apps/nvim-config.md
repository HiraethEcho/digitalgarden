# My neovim

My [config](https://github.com/HiraethEcho/nvim) on github.

I'm using nvim as a code editor, mainly for latex and markdown.

## Usage

### latex

using vimtex to detect math environment, and texlab lsp to complie.

~~cmp~~ blink.cmp and ~~ultisnips~~ luasnip to enhance editing.

check [this wiki](/wiki/code/vimtex).

### markdown

mkdnflow to enhance.

~~<kbd>leader</kbd><kbd>m</kbd><kbd>p</kbd> to open markdown-preview~~ This is not necessary. Just render it in the terminal.

## Detail Configure

### options

in /lua/config/options.lua

### lsp

Config lsp by native nvim. Steal serval functions from nvim-lspconfig.
